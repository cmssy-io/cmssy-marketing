The theme is split into semantic tokens that adapt to light and dark modes:</p><ul><li><code>--background</code> / <code>--foreground</code> — page background and text</li><li><code>--primary</code> / <code>--primary-foreground</code> — primary action buttons</li><li><code>--muted</code> / <code>--muted-foreground</code> — subtle backgrounds and helper text</li><li><code>--card</code> / <code>--card-foreground</code> — card surfaces</li><li><code>--border</code> — default border color</li><li><code>--destructive</code> — error and danger states</li></ul><h2 id=\"customizing-colors\">Customizing Colors</h2><p>Edit the <code>:root</code> block in <code>styles/main.css</code> to change your color palette. Use OKLCH values for perceptual uniformity:</p><h2 id=\"dark-mode\">Dark Mode</h2><p>Dark mode is controlled by the <code>.dark</code> class on the root element. Override the same variables in the <code>.dark</code> selector:</p><h2 id=\"tailwind-v4\">Tailwind CSS v4</h2><p>The project uses Tailwind CSS v4 with CSS-first configuration. Key differences from v3:</p><ul><li>No <code>tailwind.config.js</code> — everything lives in CSS</li><li><code>@theme inline</code> maps CSS variables to Tailwind utilities</li><li><code>@source</code> directives tell Tailwind which files to scan for class names</li><li>Gradient classes use <code>bg-linear-to-r</code> instead of <code>bg-gradient-to-r</code></li><li>Shadow scale shifted: <code>shadow-sm</code> in v4 = old bare <code>shadow</code></li></ul><h2 id=\"border-radius\">Border Radius</h2><p>Border radius uses a base <code>--radius</code> variable. All radius tokens are derived from it:</p><ul><li><code>rounded-sm</code> = <code>calc(var(--radius) - 4px)</code></li><li><code>rounded-md</code> = <code>calc(var(--radius) - 2px)</code></li><li><code>rounded-lg</code> = <code>var(--radius)</code> (10px default)</li><li><code>rounded-xl</code> = <code>calc(var(--radius) + 4px)</code></li></ul>",
